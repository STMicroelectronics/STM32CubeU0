## <b>RNG_GenerateRandomNumbers Example Description</b>

Configuration of the RNG to generate 32-bit long random numbers. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service
functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example execution:
After startup from reset and system configuration, RNG configuration is performed.
(Configure PLLSAI1 to enable 48M domain, then enable PLLSAI1 output mapped on 48MHz domain clock
and configure PLLSAI as RNG clock source).

User is then asked to press User push-button (LED4 blinking fast).
On User push-button press, several (8) Random 32bit numbers are generated
(DRDY flag is polled until 1, indicating a random number has been generated and could be retrieved from DR register).
Corresponding generated values are available and stored in a u32 array (aRandom32bit),
whose content could be displayed using debugger (Watch or LiveWatch features).
After successful Random numbers generation, LED4 is turned On.
In case of errors, LED4 is slowly blinking (1sec period).

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b> 

  - This example runs on STM32U083RCTx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-U083RC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
 - Push User push-button and use Variable watch window from debugger to access to values of generated numbers.
   (A break point could be set on LED_On() call, at end of RandomNumbersGeneration() function).
