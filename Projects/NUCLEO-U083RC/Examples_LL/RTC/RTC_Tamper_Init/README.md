## <b>RTC_Tamper_Init Example Description</b>

Configuration of the Tamper using the RTC LL API. The peripheral initialization
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSI as clock source.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the Configure_RTC() function
(configure of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware CLOCK,
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

The associated firmware performs the following:

1. It configures the Tamper pin to be rising edge, and enables the Tamper
   interrupt.

2. It writes the data to all RTC Backup data registers, then check whether the
   data were correctly written. If yes, LED4 toggles with a fast period,
   otherwise LED4 toggles with a period of 1s.

3. Applying a low level on the tamper 1 (pin PC13)
   the RTC backup data registers are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated.
   The corresponding ISR then checks whether the RTC Backup data registers are cleared.
   If yes LED4 turns on, otherwise LED4 toggles with a period of 1s.

**Note :** On this board, the tamper 1 pin is connected to User push-button (connection to pin PC.13).
