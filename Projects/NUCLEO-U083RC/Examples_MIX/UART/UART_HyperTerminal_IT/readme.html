<h2><b>UART_HyperTerminal_IT Example Description</b></h2>
<p>Use of a UART to transmit data (transmit/receive) between a board and
an HyperTerminal PC application in Interrupt mode. This example
describes how to use the USART peripheral through the STM32U0xx UART HAL
and LL API, the LL API being used for performance improvement.</p>
<pre><code>   Board: NUCLEO-U083RC
   - Tx Pin: PA.02 (available through VCP)
   - Rx Pin: PA.03 (available through VCP)</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is
called to reset all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and
the systick.</p>
<p>Then the <em>SystemClock_Config()</em> function is used to configure
the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.</p>
<p>The UART peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_UART_Init()
function. This later is calling the HAL_UART_MspInit() function which
core is implementing the configuration of the needed UART resources
according to the used hardware. You may update this function to change
UART configuration.</p>
<p>The UART/Hyperterminal communication is then initiated. Receive and
Transmit functions which allow respectively the reception of Data from
Hyperterminal and the transmission of a predefined data buffer, are
implemented using LL USART API.</p>
<p>The Asynchronous communication aspect of the UART is clearly
highlighted as the data buffers transmission/reception to/from
Hyperterminal are done simultaneously.</p>
<p>For this example the TX buffer (aTxStartMessage) is predefined and
the RX buffer (aRxBuffer) size is limited to 10 data by the mean of the
RXBUFFERSIZE define in the main.c file.</p>
<p>In a first step the received data will be stored in the RX buffer and
the TX buffer content will be displayed in the Hyperterminal interface.
In a second step the received data in the RX buffer will be sent back to
Hyperterminal and displayed.</p>
<p>STM32 Nucleo boardâ€™s LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer
status:</p>
<ul>
<li>LED4 toggles when the transmission process is complete.</li>
<li>LED4 stays ON when the reception process is complete.</li>
<li>LED4 is OFF when there is an error in transmission/reception
process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The UART is configured as follows:</p>
<pre><code>- BaudRate = 9600 baud
- Word Length = 8 Bits 
- One Stop Bit
- Odd parity
- Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
- Reception and transmission are enabled in the time</code></pre>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at
the MSB position of the transmitted data.</p></li>
<li><p>Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides
accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in
SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a
peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher
priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise
the caller ISR process will be blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt
priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.</p></li>
<li><p>The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is
always set to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.</p></li>

<p><b>Hardware and Software environment</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This example runs on STM32U083RCTx devices.</p></li>
<li><p>This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics
NUCLEO-U083RC board and can be easily tailored to any other supported
device and development board.</p></li>
<li><p>NUCLEO-U083RC Set-up Example is delivered for using Virtual Com
port feature of STLINK for connection between NUCLEO-U083RC and PC,
Please ensure that USART communication between the target MCU and
ST-LINK MCU is properly enabled on HW board in order to support Virtual
Com Port (Default HW SB configuration allows use of VCP) GPIOs connected
to USART2 TX/RX (PA2 and PA3) are automatically mapped on RX and TX pins
of PC UART Com port selected on PC side (please ensure VCP com port is
selected).</p></li>
<li><p>Launch serial communication SW on PC (as HyperTerminal or
TeraTerm) with proper configuration</p>
<ul>
<li>Word Length = 8 Bits</li>
<li>One Stop Bit</li>
<li>Odd parity</li>
<li>BaudRate = 9600 baud</li>
<li>Flow control: None</li>
</ul></li>
