## <b>ROT_Provisioning Description</b>

This section provides an overview of the available scripts for OEMiROT boot path.

OEMiROT stands for "OEM Immutable Root of Trust" and it provides two services:

  - Secure Boot: Verification of the integrity, and authenticity of the application code before any execution.
  - Secure Firmware Update: If a new firmware image is available on detection, check of its authenticity.
    Once the firmware is decrypted, check of the integrity of the code before installing it.

The provisioning script is in charge of target provisioning.

### <b>Keywords</b>

OEMiROT, boot path, Root Of Trust, Security, mcuboot

### **Directory contents**

<b>Sub-directories</b>

- OEMiROT/Binary                               Output binaries and generated images.
- OEMiROT/Image                                Image configuration files.
- OEMiROT/Keys                                 Keys for firmware image authentication and encryption.

<b>Scripts</b>

- OEMiROT/ob_flash_programming.bat/.sh         Programs option bytes and firmware image on the device.
- OEMiROT/provisioning.bat/.sh                 Performs device provisioning process.
- OEMiROT/regression.bat/.sh                   Performs full regression of the device.
- OEMiROT/keygen.bat/.sh                       Configuring keys for authentication and encryption.

### **Hardware and Software environment**

- This example runs on **STM32U083xx** devices.
- This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics **NUCLEO-U083RC** (MB1932)
board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


### **How to use it?**

To use OEMiRoT bootpath, you should first configure ROT_Provisioning/env.bat/.sh script
(tools path, application path).<br>
The .bat scripts are designed for Windows, whereas the .sh scripts are designed for Linux and Mac-OS.

<b>provisioning.bat/.sh</b>

This script performs the **provisioning process**.<br>
During the **provisioning process**, the programming scripts and the application files will
be automatically updated according to OEMiROT configuration, and user answers.

The **provisioning process** (OEMiROT/provisioning.bat/.sh) is divided into 3 majors steps:

- Step 1: Product configuration
- Step 2: Image generations
- Step 3: Provisioning

The provisioning script is relying on ob_flash_programming script.

<b>regression.bat/.sh</b>

This script performs the full regression of the device: erases the user flash memory and resets
the RDP level to 0.

### <b>Notes</b>

Two versions of AppliCfg (used during **provisioning process**) are available: windows executable and python version.<br>
On Windows environment, the executable is used. On other environment, the python version is automatically used.<br>
To use Python version, it is needed to:

- have python installed (Python 3.6 or newer) and available in execution path variable
- have required python modules installed (Utilities/PC_Software/ROT_AppliConfig/requirements.txt):

        pip install -r requirements.txt
