## <b>ROT_Provisioning Description</b>

This section provides available configuration scripts for OEMiROT example.


To ease the configuration process, a keygen, ob_flash_programming and provisioning scripts are used.
The keygen is in charge of preparing the authentication and encryption keys.
The ob_flash_programming is in charge of Initializing Option Bytes and Image download.
The provisioning script is in charge of target provisioning.

board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

### **How to use it?**


Before compiling the OEMiROT project, you should first start the provisioning process. During the provisioning process, the linker files
of project as well as the postbuild commands will be automatically updated.

All scripts are relying on env.bat/env.sh for tool path and application path.

The **provisioning process** (ROT\_Provisioning/OEMiROT/provisioning.bat/.sh) is divided into 4 majors steps :

* Step 1 : Selecting the RDP level

	+ Select RDP Level

* Step 2 : Boot, Appli and local loader building

	+ OEMiROT boot binary: build OEMiROT\_Boot project
	+ OEMiROT Appli binary: build OEMiROT\_Appli project
	+ OEMiROT Loader binary: build OEMiROT\_Loader project

* Step 3 : Images generation

	+ Code firmware image generation: automatically generated at the end of compilation (postbuild command)
	+ Data image generation with TrustedPackageCreator, if data image enabled

* Step 4 : Provisioning

	+ Programming the Option Bytes
	+ Flashing the images
	+ Setting the RDP level


The provisioning script is relying on ob_flash_programming script.
It is possible to run ob_flash_programming directly(advanced mode).

The **ob_flash_programming process** (ROT\_Provisioning/OEMiROT/ob_flash_programming.bat/.sh) include :

* Step 1 : Initialize option bytes

* Step 2 : Configure the option Bytes

	+ Remove Protection and erase all.
	+ Configure option Bytes.

* Step 3 : Download Images

	+ Download boot image.
	+ Download Appli image
	+ Download data image, if data image enabled.
	+ Download loader image, if loader enabled.

The **keygen process** (ROT\_Provisioning/OEMiROT/keygen.bat/.sh) include :

* Step 1 : ECC 256 authentication key generation.

* Step 2 : Generation of private key to encode images.
