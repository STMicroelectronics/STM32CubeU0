## <b>OPAMP_PGA Example Description</b>

This example shows how to use the built-in PGA mode (OPAMP programmable gain).

- Test description:

      - The example uses the the built-in PGA mode (OPAMP programmable gain).
      - The DMA provides samples (sinewave) to the DAC.
      - The DAC peripheral generates a sine wave signal on DAC1/DAC_CHANNEL_1 (PA4) which is amplified by the OPAMP1.
      - The OPAMP1 amplifies output is on PA3 with gain of either 2 or 4.
      - The OPAMP gain is changed on the fly while OPAMP remains enabled.
      - The test steps are:
      - Step 0:
        DAC:     normal power mode
        OPAMP:   normal power mode - gain = 2
        DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer IT handled by Cortex
        Cortex:  run mode
      - Step from 1:
        DAC:     normal power mode
        OPAMP:   normal power mode - gain is changed from 2 to 4 or from 4 to 2
        DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer IT handled by Cortex
        Cortex:  run mode

- Connection needed:

      - Connect an oscilloscope to (DAC1/DAC_CHANNEL_1, PA4: pin 3 on connector CN8)
        to display the sine wave signal generated by the DAC(800 mV amplitude peak to peak). (DAC output = OPAMP input).
      - Connect an oscilloscope to (OPAMP1_OUT, PA3: pin 1 on connector CN9) pin to display waveform
        (OPAMP output)
      - Press User push-button button to switch between steps.
      - Connect a wire between DAC output (PA4 : pin 32 on connector CN7) to OPAMP non inverting input (PA0 : pin 1 on connector CN8)

  - This example runs on STM32U0xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-U083RC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

Connect a wire between DAC output (PA4 - pin 32 on connector CN7) to OPAMP non inverting input (PA0 : pin 1 on connector CN8)
