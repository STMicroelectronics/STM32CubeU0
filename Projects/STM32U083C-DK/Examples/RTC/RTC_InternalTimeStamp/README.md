## <b>RTC_InternalTimeStamp Example Description</b> 

Demonstration the internal timestamp feature using the RTC HAL API.
The calendar is saved when an internal timestamp event is detected. The internal timestamp 
event is generated by the switch to the VBAT supply.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RTC_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_RTC_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

LSE oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source. 

HAL_RTC_SetTime()and HAL_RTC_SetDate() functions are then called to initialize the 
time and the date.

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the Initialization status flag (INITS). This bit is
   set by hardware when the calendar year field is different from 0
   (Backup domain reset state).
    - INITS is reset : Calendar has not been initialized, the RTC is
      configured and internal time stamp is enabled.
    
    - INITS is set: Calendar has been initialized and the time
      and date are displayed on LCD.

2. When a reset (except power-on reset) occurs the BKP domain is reset and the RTC 
   configuration is lost. LED4 is ON.

3. When power-on reset (POR) occurs:

    - The BKP domain is reset and the RTC configuration is lost. Calendar saved upon internal time stamp
      event detection is recovered. LED4 is ON.

LED3 is turned ON when the RTC configuration is done correctly.
LED5 is turned ON in case of error.

The current time and date are updated and displayed on LCD.

The time and date are saved when internal time stamp event is detected (i.e. when
switching to the VBAT supply). Saved time stamp is displayed on LCD.

#### <b>Notes</b>

-     Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
-     The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
