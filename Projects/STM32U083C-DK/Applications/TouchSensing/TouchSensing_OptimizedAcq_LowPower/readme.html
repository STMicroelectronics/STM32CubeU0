<h2 id="touchsensing_optimizedacq_lowpower-application-description"><b>TouchSensing_OptimizedAcq_LowPower Application Description</b></h2>
<p>Use of the TSC to perform optimized continuous acquisitions of one channel in Interrupt mode.</p>
<p>This project is targeted to run on STM32U083xx devices on STM32U083C-DK board from STMicroelectronics.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick. Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 48 MHz.</p>
<p>The TSC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_TSC_Init() function. This later is calling the HAL_TSC_MspInit()function which core is implementing the configuration of the needed TSC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO and NVIC). You may update this function to change TSC configuration.</p>
<p>The Touchsensing module allows the detection of a touch on the Touchsensor physical button TS1, and a touch on the Touchsensor virtual button TS2 to emulate a real example with 2 touch keys, this application is composed of 2 phases (Active and Idle) which will help decreasing the consumption when not using the Touch sensor for a while.</p>
<p>In this specific STM32U0xx series, some Touch IO pins are interconnected with the Comparator module which gives us the the possibility to change the detection voltage level. Changing this voltage level will help in detecting a physical Touch earlier, depending on the value of the comparator input.</p>
<p>This means that the lower the level the less time you will need to reach it and thus an acquisition cycle is smaller. In other words you will detect a physical touch quicker and this will also help reducing the current compsumption as well</p>
<p>The inputP of the comparator is connected to the physical button TS1 IO group, and the inputM is connected to the available VREF level (1/4Vref, 1/2Vref, 3/4Vref, Vref).</p>
<p>In this example, the inputP is connected to TSC_G6_IO1 (COMP_INPUT_PLUS_IO4) and the inputM to VREFINT.</p>
<p>In association of the inputM at VREF level, the threshold of the Touchsensing is tuned for the discovery through the function tsl_user_SetThresholds(). The function tsl_user_SetThresholds() set the threshold depending of the comparator inputM value.</p>
<p>Some limitation can appear if the inputM level is set too low. If it is too low Touchsensing middleware will have less range and therefore the measurement might approach the noise level. Care should be taken at this point.</p>
<p>The touchsensing module software is composed of different steps:</p>
<p>At first, the main module initialize the peripheral Touch, Comparator, RTC and middleware Touchsensing through respectively MX_TSC_Init(), MX_COMP2_Init(), MX_RTC_Init() and MX_TOUCHSENSING_Init().</p>
<p>Then, the Touchsensing/TouchWakeup module initiate the calibration of the TSC, this phase is around 10 seconds. This phase is decomposed in two steps, the first one for the calibration of the TS1 physical button without usage of the comparator. And a second step for the calibration of TS2 virtual button with usage of the comparator.</p>
<p>The LED3 (green) and LED4 (blue) are ON before initiate the calibration. Then when the calibration of TS1 physical button is terminated, the LED3 is OFF. Then when the calibration of TS2 virtual button is terminated, the LED4 is OFF</p>
<p>Finally, after starting, the RTC wakeup the MCU each 10ms, in a while loop the Touchsensing/TouchWakeup module manage a detection and no detection in this way:</p>
<p>If a touch is detected: A green LED lights up The green led switch off when the touch button is released</p>
<p>There are 2 phases in this example:</p>
<p>Idle Phase (virtual TS2): RTC wake up the MCU each 250ms and check for a touch. If a touch is detected, the LED4 is ON and the application switch to the Active Phase. LED4 is then OFF when virtual TS2 is released.</p>
<p>Active Phase (physical TS1): RTC wake up the MCU each 10ms and check for a touch this allows for a more sensitive button.</p>
<p>If it is in the Active state and no touch is detected for 5 seconds (through define NO_ACTIVITY_TIME): The application switch to the IDLE Phase, the RTC will then wakeup each 250ms. It stays in the ldle phase until a touch is detected.</p>
<p>STM32U083C-DKâ€™s LEDs can be used to monitor the Touch detection status:</p>
<ul>
<li>LED3 and LED4 are ON at calibration start process (LED3 toggle OFF then LED4 toggle OFF after each calibration (TS1 then TS2))</li>
</ul>
<p>After calibration phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>LED3 is ON when a touch on physical TS1 (Active phase without comparator) is detected.</li>
<li>LED4 is ON when a touch on virtual TS2 (Idle phase with comparator) is detected.</li>
<li>LED4 and LED 3 are OFF when STM32U083C-DK enter in low power stop 2 mode.</li>
<li>LED5 toggles when an error occurs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.</p></li>
<li><p>The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.</p></li>
